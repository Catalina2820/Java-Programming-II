# Java-Programming-II-MOOC

Progress in the "Java Programming II" course from the University of Helsinki MOOC. This course delves into advanced Java programming concepts, including working with collections, inheritance, interfaces, and building more complex applications.

This repository contains my progress in the "Java Programming II" course from the University of Helsinki MOOC. The course covers advanced Java programming topics, such as data structures, object-oriented programming, and more.

## Description

The course is part of the massive open online course (MOOC) series from the University of Helsinki on programming. It provides comprehensive materials and numerous practical exercises. The course is designed to teach advanced programming concepts in Java.

### Repository Contents

- **`exercises/`**: Contains solutions to the course's practical exercises, addressing key concepts such as data structures and algorithms.
- **`projects/`**: Projects that integrate various course topics to demonstrate the practical application of what has been learned.
- **`README.md`**: This file provides information about the content and how to run the code.

### Objective

The goal of this repository is to document my progress and learning in Java as I complete the course. It serves as a reference both for myself and anyone else interested in the course content.

## Course Parts

### Part 8

In Part 8 of the course, new important concepts are introduced, such as using `HashMap` and grouping data.

In this part, the following topics are covered:
1. Short recap
2. Hash Map
3. Similarity of objects
4. Grouping data using hash maps
5. Fast data fetching and grouping information

### Part 9

Part 9 focuses on two essential concepts in object-oriented programming: inheritance and interfaces. You will learn how to create classes that inherit from other classes and implement one or more interfaces.

In this part, the following topics are covered:
1. Class inheritance
2. Interfaces
3. Object polymorphism
4. Summary

### Part 10

Part 10 introduces handling collections with streams. You'll learn how to create a stream from a collection, filter values, transform them, and collect them into another collection. The concept of lambda expressions is also introduced.

In this part, the following topics are covered:
1. Handling collections as streams
2. The Comparable Interface
3. Other useful techniques
4. Summary

### Part 11

In Part 11, you'll learn how to decipher simple class diagrams, work with packages in Java, and use exceptions.

In this part, the following topics are covered:
1. Class diagrams
2. Packages
3. Exceptions
4. File processing
5. Conclusion

### Part 12

Part 12 introduces type parameters, helping you understand how `ArrayList<String>` works and how to implement classes that use these parameters. You'll also learn to implement your own versions of structures like `ArrayList` and `HashMap`.

In this part, the following topics are covered:
1. Type parameters
2. ArrayList and hash tables
3. Randomness
4. Multidimensional data
5. Summary

### Part 13

In Part 13, you'll be introduced to graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and how to handle events in GUI-based applications.

In this part, the following topics are covered:
1. Graphical user interfaces
2. UI components and their layout
3. Event handling
4. Application launch parameters
5. Multiple views
6. Summary

### Part 14

In Part 14, you'll learn methods for data visualization and work with charts. You'll also explore image processing and audio file playback.

In this part, the following topics are covered:
1. Data visualization
2. Multimedia in programs
3. Larger application: Asteroids
4. Maven and third-party libraries
5. Conclusion
